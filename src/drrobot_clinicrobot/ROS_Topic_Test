Android USB Drivers (Linux)
On Linux, USB Drivers are not used like they are on Windows. Instead, you must create a udev file. (Note, on Macs, the device should just work without doing anything).\r\n\r\nYou will need to set up the device if you want to root, mod, install roms, use ADB, or anything development or hacking-like between your computer and the phone.\r\n\r\nAfter you\'ve completed the following process, you can verify your device connects successfully by using adb devices in a terminal (if you have adb set up).\r\n\r\n

    \r\n
    If you\'re using Linux, then you need to make a udev file for the device that you are using. Each device manufacturer is identified by a unique vendor ID
    \r\n
    Log in as root and create this file: /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
    \r\n
    For help with writing udev files, click here. Use the following format to add each vendor (Vendor IDs are below) to the file: SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTR{idVendor}==\"18D1\", MODE=\"0666\", GROUP=\"plugdev\"
    \r\n
    Then execute chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules and then the drivers are set up successfully.

    \r\nThis table provides a reference to the vendor IDs needed in order to add USB device support on Linux. The USB Vendor ID is the value given to the ATTR{idVendor} property in the rules file, as described above.\r\n
